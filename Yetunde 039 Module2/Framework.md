The framework adopted by KUDI is the Two equal parts. 

KUDI was birthed through the identification of the need of regular people to have better access to their hard earned funds via the banking systems.

 This discovery made KUDI realize that they needed a POS terminal to reduce the issue by granting people easier access to their money while curbing the stress involved in most underbanked environments.  
 
 The POS terminal that was given out to their agent, made them see the gap that more information was  needed from their agents on how well the POS serves its intended purpose. 
 
 Also they discovered that they need an app which was the best solution for them to converse, any complain from the agent will be communicated to KUDI via the app. 
 
  Kudi understood key features to prioritize to have an amazing customer retention and growth. Hence, this has grown the customer base to 20,000 users with over 500,000 transactions per day which lead to a 20% increase in the usage  of the POS.

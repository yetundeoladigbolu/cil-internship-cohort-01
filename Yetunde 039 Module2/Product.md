 Preferred product i will be talking about is (KUDI BANKING AGENCY)
   
 KUDI is a chatbot to help you send money and pay bills, but they did not stop there, which they realise that many people can't access financial services across Nigeria and they wanted to help. they dug further to real problems and decided to create kudi app for agents.

Regardless of all transaction you try to preform, while stranded in the urban city setting or chilling with friends and you want to pay bills or you want reside in an extremely remote part of the continent in need of a banking experience, know that see and they build for you.

Today they make financial services accessible and affordable particularly to the banked, underbanked and unbanked.
 
Kudi is bridging the gap of financial inclusion to ensure about 20% of un-banked Nigerians have access to banking platform. The approach is to offer this service at N20 for transactions within the range (N100-4,500) and N150 for withdrawals above N25,000.
